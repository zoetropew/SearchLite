Search Engine
=================================================

A full-stack web search engine using multithreading and file/web crawling in Java. Users can add files or links to the database and search queries efficiently for relevant results. Webpages added will be crawled for other contained links to add in order to gather more data for searches. If curious, users can also browse the full list of currently available pages and files with a list of keywords from each without searching any query.
